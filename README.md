# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

When I started doing my prework for bootcamp I feel a liitle lost because most of the terms used are new for me and this motivate me to work on this project and I decide to create this webpage to find every possible help to make my time in bootcamp succesfull. It does help me to study and to remember little details that are needed in my carrer as a student and as a profesional. I learned how to use Git Bash, Git Hub, VS Code, HTML, CSS, Javascript and a lot more.
